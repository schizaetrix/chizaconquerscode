    <p>In regards to web development, I've successfully taught myself several relevant skills throughout the years - graphic design, digital art, mastery of CMS tools and WYSIWYG editors. One major skill has eluded me to this day, though it hasn't been for lack of trying.</p>
    <p>I don't know what it is about learning to code that has been so challenging for me to do on my own. HTML and CSS is one thing, but once I try my hand at actual scripting and programming languages, I feel like I'm back in middle school math class. Do you remember that feeling of plugging numbers into an equation and crossing your fingers that you put them in the right place, because you don't actually understand what you're doing? That's me in Codecademy, Lynda, Udemy and pretty much every resource I've tried to teach myself to code.</p>
    <p>Enrolling for the coding bootcamp at DigitalCrafts is my way of putting my foot down and learning this thing once and for all. </p>
    <p>By taking the DigitalCrafts bootcamp, I intend to acquire the following skills and benefits:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mastery of the syntax and basic usage of HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, React.js, and other elements of full-stack web development</li>
      <li>A fuller understanding of how to take a website or web app from the planning stage, through development to final execution</li>
      <li>The ability to apply my newly acquired skills to my current role at Six Foot Staffing, to be able to code the company website from scratch and develop tools for tracking recruitment activities</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As of writing this, the Six Foot Staffing website was created using Wordpress, a StudioPress base theme and Elementor Pro site builder. Our home on the web is at <a href="https://www.sixfootstaffing.com">www.sixfootstaffing.com</a>.</p>
